## Overview
This program runs **Prime Generation** on the CPU and **Hashing Algorithms** on the GPU to generate as much heat as possible.
I made this because I was cold, but I guess you could use this for thermal testing.

## Usage
- **Launch**: Run the program.
- **Profit?**: PC gets warm!
- **Hot Enought?**: Press Esc or Close the program

## Command Line Arguments

    --fullscreen    - Launch the fireplace movie in fullscreen, but you can press F11 to fullscreen as well.
